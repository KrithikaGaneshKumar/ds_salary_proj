Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker, and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today things are different. The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story.

The roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives.

Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.

But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.

Our Company & Culture

We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win.

"Common Networks , Inc.
4.6",2016,"Cable, Internet & Telephone Providers","Common Networks was founded on the idea that everyone should have a choice for fast, affordable access to broadband internet. Right now, most homes in the U.S. don't. In fact, 62% of homes live in a monopoly broadband market. High-speed access unlocks all the superpowers on the internet. When it works, it can be a great leveling force across the world, giving everyone access to educational tools, entertainment, immediate translations, or even medical care that they wouldn’t otherwise have.

Common Networks provides suburban neighborhoods with internet using wireless technology. We interconnect homes in a neighborhood, creating a mesh network between homes and our fiber internet sources. A whole community can then have fast and reliable internet service with only a few locations needing fiber access.

As our first Data Scientist, you will own our entire data pipeline, from instrumentation and extraction to analytical presentations to the executive team. Building Internet infrastructure is expensive and our business model relies on leveraging data to find as many efficiencies as possible. To that end, you’ll work with Product to find creative ways to reduce hardware costs, with Growth to squeeze every last conversion out of our onboarding funnel, with Engineering to discern network-wide ramifications of minute changes to router kernel parameters, with Coverage to sketch out the best buildings to target when we launch new markets, and with Operations to identify process breaks before they show up in our top-level metrics.

The ideal candidate is passionate about democratizing our data and eager to wear many hats -- one day might entail installing Tableau and coaching stakeholders on best practices with the new BI tool, while another might involve changing our backend to emit that one metric that’s going to drastically simplify the analysis you’re trying to run. Our entire stack runs on GCP, with BigQuery as our data warehouse and all of our backend written in golang on Google’s Appengine -- bonus points if you come in with experience in those technologies, but we’d also be thrilled to invest in a great candidate that hasn’t worked with those exact products.
What you do
Build and maintain dashboards for core operational metrics (e.g. network reliability, growth funnel)
Own the methodologies behind how we measure ourselves and create new metrics as the business evolves
Clean and organize our data warehouse, manage scheduled aggregations, and expose rich views of data to stakeholders
Run your own investigations into our trickiest problems, finding approachable ways to present and visualize your findings to the rest of the company
Implement simple changes to our codebase when necessary -- you don’t let yourself get blocked on engineering
Chart out Common’s data roadmap, striking the right balance between quick-and-dirty analysis vs. building out robust, scalable data flows.
Requirements
BS with 5+ years of professional experience in a Data Scientist or Data Analyst role
Solid programming skills in at least one language in addition to excellent SQL skills
Experience working with and manipulating large, complex datasets.
Experience solving non-routine analysis problems, choosing the appropriate analytical methods and carrying the entire analysis from initial data gathering and requirements specification to final reporting and stakeholder presentation
Experience building, managing and organizing ETLs and data pipelinesExperience working with stakeholders to produce golden data datasets and clear views of common data needs
Excited to work in a startup environment on a small team; creative, resourceful, comfortable in a fast-moving environment. Excited to take on a wide range of responsibilities and cover many different roles loosely aligned around Data.

Watchful Technologies Ltd.,-1,-1,"Watchful is a platform that makes machine teaching easy, scalable, and automated. The biggest blocker to delivering ML models in production is no longer the algorithms, but the data (or lack thereof) to train the models. Currently, this has been solved by scaling-out human annotators or labelers and there are a number of managed services that have risen to meet this need. However, for use cases that require specific context (intelligence, legal, cyber, etc.) and/or is based on sensitive or classified data, these solutions are untenable.

Watchful is a disruptive automated annotation platform that puts the power back in the hands of data scientists and subject matter experts to label orders of magnitude more data, in orders of magnitude less time.

Who we are

Dyno Therapeutics is a Cambridge based, VC-backed biotech startup that uses next-gen DNA technologies and machine learning to engineer Adeno-associated Virus (AAV) capsids for the effective delivery of gene therapies.

What we offer you

As a member of our quickly growing company, you’ll help us shape Dyno into a startup that takes its scientific mission seriously and provides a positive and supportive workplace environment. Dyno will have the opportunity to benefit from your insight, skills, and talent while enriching your professional and scientific experience as we grow the company together.

Our mission

At Dyno, we are expanding the boundaries of gene therapy. AAV capsids are currently the vector of choice for gene therapy, but they are only a starting point in the gene therapy revolution. Dyno aims to dramatically extend the reach of gene therapy by overcoming the limitations of existing AAV capsids, allowing more therapies to reach the clinic. Doing so will enable treatment for millions of patients with currently incurable, often disabling and deadly diseases.

How?

Dyno’s groundbreaking engineering pipeline harnesses advances in DNA library synthesis, high-throughput sequencing, and machine learning to generate transformative gene therapy vectors. We target the major barriers that separate AAV gene therapy research from real-world therapies, including delivery efficiency, tissue and cell-type specificity, immune evasion, and more. Our vectors will accelerate the transition of gene therapies from the lab to the clinic for the benefit of patients worldwide.

Where?

Dyno is located near Kendall Square in Cambridge. Situated within the dynamic LabCentral community, Dyno is working alongside other startups that are also creating the future of biomedicine.

General role

Who we are

Dyno Therapeutics is a Cambridge based, VC-backed biotech startup that uses next-gen DNA technologies and machine learning to engineer Adeno-associated Virus (AAV) capsids for the effective delivery of gene therapies.

What we offer you

As a member of our quickly growing company, you’ll help us shape Dyno into a startup that takes its scientific mission seriously and provides a positive and supportive workplace environment. Dyno will have the opportunity to benefit from your insight, skills, and talent while enriching your professional and scientific experience as we grow the company together.

Our mission

At Dyno, we are expanding the boundaries of gene therapy. AAV capsids are currently the vector of choice for gene therapy, but they are only a starting point in the gene therapy revolution. Dyno aims to dramatically extend the reach of gene therapy by overcoming the limitations of existing AAV capsids, allowing more therapies to reach the clinic. Doing so will enable treatment for millions of patients with currently incurable, often disabling and deadly diseases.

How?

Dyno’s groundbreaking engineering pipeline harnesses advances in DNA library synthesis, high-throughput sequencing, and machine learning to generate transformative gene therapy vectors. We target the major barriers that separate AAV gene therapy research from real-world therapies, including delivery efficiency, tissue and cell-type specificity, immune evasion, and more. Our vectors will accelerate the transition of gene therapies from the lab to the clinic for the benefit of patients worldwide.

Where?

Dyno is located near Kendall Square in Cambridge. Situated within the dynamic LabCentral community, Dyno is working alongside other startups that are also creating the future of biomedicine.

General role

The data science team is at the heart of Dyno’s platform, and your work as a part of this team will have a potentially major impact on the future of gene therapy. The team's responsibilities span biological data analysis, machine learning model building, computational optimization, and experimental design of high-throughput viral libraries. Opportunities to apply rigorous theoretical approaches from combinatorial optimization, bayesian optimization, bandit strategies, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and compressive sensing in our platform abound. The successful candidate will have expertise in one of these (or related) topics and would like to apply them to a new domain. The field of capsid engineering is ripe with problems that are interesting from a learning perspective, and Dyno is well-placed to generate data at a scale at which these approaches can be fruitful.

Presbyterian Healthcare Services is a locally owned, not-for-profit healthcare system of nine hospitals, a statewide health plan and a growing multi-specialty medical group. Founded in New Mexico in 1908, it is the state's largest private employer with approximately 11,000 employees.

Presbyterian's story is really the story of the remarkable people who have chosen to work here. Starting with Reverend Cooper who began our journey in 1908, the hard work of thousands of physicians, employees, board members, and other volunteers brought Presbyterian from a tiny tuberculosis sanatorium to a statewide healthcare system, serving more than 700,000 New Mexicans.

We are part of New Mexico's history - and committed to its future. That is why we will continue to work just as hard and care just as deeply to serve New Mexico for years to come.

About New Mexico
New Mexico's unique blend of Spanish, Mexican and Native American influences contribute to a culturally rich lifestyle. Add in Albuquerque's International Balloon Fiesta, Los Alamos' nuclear scientists, Roswell's visitors from outer space, and Santa Fe's artists, and you get an eclectic mix of people, places and experiences that make this state great.

Cities in New Mexico are continually ranked among the nation's best places to work and live by Forbes magazine, Kiplinger's Personal Finance, and other corporate and government relocation managers like Worldwide ERC.

New Mexico offers endless recreational opportunities to explore, and enjoy an active lifestyle. Venture off the beaten path, challenge your body in the elements, or open yourself up to the expansive sky.

About Us VIDEO

Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.

You

As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.

The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""

Us

The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.

Your Day

While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:
Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.
Required Skills / Experiences
Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.

This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.
Desired Skills / Experiences
2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.
Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.
You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.
Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.

Dyno Therapeutics Inc.,-1,-1,"Come join our team, and together we’ll realize the true potential of gene therapy!

Who we are

Dyno Therapeutics is a Cambridge based, VC-backed biotech startup that uses next-gen DNA technologies and machine learning to engineer Adeno-associated Virus (AAV) capsids for the effective delivery of gene therapies.

What we offer you

As a member of our quickly growing company, you’ll help us shape Dyno into a startup that takes its scientific mission seriously and provides a positive and supportive workplace environment. Dyno will have the opportunity to benefit from your insight, skills, and talent while enriching your professional and scientific experience as we grow the company together.

Our mission

At Dyno, we are expanding the boundaries of gene therapy. AAV capsids are currently the vector of choice for gene therapy, but they are only a starting point in the gene therapy revolution. Dyno aims to dramatically extend the reach of gene therapy by overcoming the limitations of existing AAV capsids, allowing more therapies to reach the clinic. Doing so will enable treatment for millions of patients with currently incurable, often disabling and deadly diseases.

How?

Dyno’s groundbreaking engineering pipeline harnesses advances in DNA library synthesis, high-throughput sequencing, and machine learning to generate transformative gene therapy vectors. We target the major barriers that separate AAV gene therapy research from real-world therapies, including delivery efficiency, tissue and cell-type specificity, immune evasion, and more. Our vectors will accelerate the transition of gene therapies from the lab to the clinic for the benefit of patients worldwide.

Where?

Dyno is located near Kendall Square in Cambridge. Situated within the dynamic LabCentral community, Dyno is working alongside other startups that are also creating the future of biomedicine.

General role

The data science team is at the heart of Dyno’s platform, and your work as a part of this team will have a potentially major impact on the future of gene therapy. The team's responsibilities span biological data analysis, machine learning model building, computational optimization, and experimental design of high-throughput viral libraries. Opportunities to apply rigorous theoretical approaches from combinatorial optimization, bayesian optimization, bandit strategies, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and compressive sensing in our platform abound. The successful candidate will have expertise in one of these (or related) topics and would like to apply them to a new domain. The field of capsid engineering is ripe with problems that are interesting from a learning perspective, and Dyno is well-placed to generate data at a scale at which these approaches can be fruitful.

As an early member of our team, you will have the opportunity to help craft our approach, shape our culture, and positively impact people’s lives. You will work closely with a group of talented, driven, and fun scientists. We are located in Lab Central in a dynamic community of biotech startups. The guideline below should give you a rough picture of who we are looking for, but depending on your background, you may bring different qualities to our team.

Clinical - Who is going to get sick? What can we do to prevent or mitigate these health events? When is the best time to implement these actions? This application of data science examines the drivers of clinical outcomes; analyzes opportunities for managing risk-based populations; evaluates programs and interventions that aim to improve patient outcomes.
Quality How is quality of care measured and how is it related to patient outcomes? Where are opportunities to improve the quality of care to our patients and members? Our data scientists serve as subject matter experts on healthcare quality measurement and risk adjustment; use predictive modeling to identify patient populations in need of clinical interventions; identify opportunities for improvement in clinical processes that can lead to improved quality of care.
Operational How can we optimize our business operations in order to be more efficient? How do we deliver our services in order to improve the coordination of care for our patients and members? This application of data science focuses on efficiency and optimization of business practices in order to improve patient care; uses techniques including time series forecasting and geospatial analysis to address business problems such as staffing and scheduling; analyzes opportunities for business growth within the organization and predicts and forecasts expenses.
Policy What is the impact of health care policy on our patient population? On our most vulnerable patients and members? How will changes in reimbursement policy affect the way we deliver patient care? What partnerships can we develop in order to ensure that our patients and members continue receiving optimal care? Our data scientists are well-versed in healthcare policy; analyze areas for meaningful value investments that focus on improving health outcomes while saving money; use predictive modeling to identify high cost and high need patient populations who may be impacted most by changes in health policy.
